Django - High-level Python Web Framework
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
Python's equivalent to the famous Ruby on rails, Django lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly. 
Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
